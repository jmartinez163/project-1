            Maybe tonight you didn't make the best decisions, but at the end of the day you still got your assignment done, and that's
            all that matters, right? As you're getting ready to submit your final paper that will essentially be your ticket yo your
            college graduation a loud alarm beginns to sound. You can't detect where it's coming, it's not your car or your home security
            system so what can it be? Confused, you search for the source of the sound, but you have no luck. Suddenly you feel as if
            someone grabbed you by the shoulders and is shaking you. It's at this moment when you realize that the sound is your alarm
            clock and the person shaking you is your mother attempting to wake you up so you wont be late for your first day of middle
            school. I guess that you still have quite a ways to go before that dream can actually come true.
