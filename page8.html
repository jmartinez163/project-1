            You knew that you weren't making the best decisions, but you still went ahead and did things. As a result of your actions
            you were arrested, and what for? All because of one party that everyone was going to be talking about. Now, you're evryone
            people are going to be talking about as you have thrown away your degree and esentially your future all for one night.
            Wasn't worth it, was it? Of course not! Not only did you jeopardize your life but innocent lives as well and for that you
            must be punished. You are hereby sentenced to life without sports! Yes, this may be considered a cruel punishment but your
            actions call for drastic reactions. I hope you learn your lesson!
