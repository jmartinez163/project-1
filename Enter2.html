          <p class="p2"> Youre either really easy to convince or Johny is just one extremely persuasive human being. Whichever the reason
          may be, you gave in to peer pressure and now find yourself getting ready to attend this party. You make very clear to yourself and
          most importantly, to Johny that you will only be there until midnight, and that you will be absolutely not be taking part in any
          consumption of alcohol. Confidently he can convince yet again, you and Johny leave, before going to the party you stop at one of
          his friends house and ofcourse, they are drinking. Johny, lets everyone know that you don,t plan on drinking, and now all of a
          sudden everyone has made it their mission to get you to drink.</p>
