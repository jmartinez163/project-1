            You think to yourself "what the heck, one wont hurt" and decide to take them up on the offer. Without realizing it that "one"
            drink very quickly doubled, again and again. You're now at a point of intoxication that you can barely stand and yet alone walk.
            You step outside for a minute in a last minute attempt to get away from everyone and the alcohol especially with hopes of being able
            to somewhat sober up, it works. having a minute to yourself you realize that you can "afford" tonight because your paper isnt due for
            another 36 hours, at the same time, you know that if you stay out any longer you'll more than likely spend all day tomorrow in bed.
            In a way, you're right back where you started so you ask yourself what should you do?
