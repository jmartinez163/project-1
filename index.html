          <p>  You are are a 22 year old senior at California State Univeristy, Chico, it is the last Friday of the semester and everyone is
          out enjoying themselves. You on the other hand are stuck starring at your computer screen because you have one more assignment to
          turn in, an assignment that will determine whether or not you graduate. At the same time your phone is being bombarded with messages
          of people desperately trying to get you to go out, determined to finish, you turn off your phone and carry on with your work. However,
          there's Johny, your roomate, who unlike your phone you can't just turn off and ignore. He's been talking about a giant party he was
          invited for weeks and wont stop bothering you about going with him.</p>
