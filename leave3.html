            You're in your zone, the ideas are just flowing to you, and your paper is essentially writing itself. You figured everyone got the
            point that your decision to not go out was final and decide to turn on your phone. To your surprise you have eight missed calls
            and 4 texts urging you to go to Johny's friend's house because something was terribly wrong with your roomate. Fearing the worst
            you race over. Upon your arrival, you race into the house shouting for Johny and trying to make sure hes fine. To your surprise,
            the first person you see upon entering the house is Johny, who's having the time of his life dancing on top of a table. Its at
            this moment when you realize that this was all part of a plan to get you to leave the house and attend the party!
