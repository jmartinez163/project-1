            Once in the house you notice how massive the party actually is. You also know that this is the "one". This is the party
            that everyone will be talking about, do you really want to be the guy that misses it? Of course not! You convince yourself
            that you'll be ok and that you'll be able to get your assignment done still. As the night progresses into the early morning,
            you are extremely hammered! It's so bad that you've lost your keys, phone, wallet, and Johny, the reason you were there in
            the first place. Not long after police are called to shut down the party and forcing everyoe to go home. As you stumble home
            you notice Johny's car parked on the side of the road. You decide to take a closer look and see that Johny is actually sleeping
            inside the car, your attempts to wake him up are useless.
