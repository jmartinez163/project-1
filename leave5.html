            You very quickly realieze that if you stay there any longer it'll be a matter of minutes before you give-in to peer pressure again so
            you decide to call it a night and head home. On your way home you pass by a late-night taco stand and the smell just reels you in. As
            you're waiting for your food, an older gentleman approaches your table and very calmly sits directly across from you. Without warning
            he begins telling you the story of how he was once a college student and how he was one assignment from graduating, but because of
            one bad decision that assignment never got done and he never graduated. Terrified that this might happen to you, you rush home. once
            home, you realze that you dropped your keys and the only way to get into the house is to eother go back to the party and look for
            them or to climb through the second-story window.
